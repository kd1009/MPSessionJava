First of all I would like to thank my supervisor, Nobuko Yoshida, for all her help and guidance in this project and the many hours she spent supervising my efforts. Her comments and suggestions made this work significantly better and without her it would have been very hard to produce any results.

My special gratitude should be expressed to Olivier Pernet for all his support and the great amount of explanations, ideas and help he provided that allowed me to complete this my work. His technical insights and extensive knowledge of the field enabled me to complete this project.

I would also like to thank all my course friends and professors at Imperial College who made this year a great learning experience. It is their support, motivation and humour that made this course so enjoyable.
