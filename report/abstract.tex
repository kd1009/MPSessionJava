The current trend in computing is towards distributed structured interactions between $n$ nodes in a cooperative environment. It is often crucial for these communications to adhere to rigorous structures in order to achieve their goals. This report utilises the recently developed multiparty session type theory as a means of structuring such interactions in a concise syntax and combines them with an integration of binary session types into the Java programming language called SessionJava. We present Multiparty SessionJava, as a framework for declaring global session types to specify structured interactions, and implementing the operations at each session participant accordingly. Our compiler and runtime extensions provide a foundation for type-checking these interactions to ensure type-safe communications based on projections of the global types onto local session participants. To our best knowledge this is the second exisiting attempt to provide a user friendly syntax and protocol-centred operations for typed multiparty interactions in Java.
