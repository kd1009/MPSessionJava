The current trend in computing is towards distributed structured interactions between $n$ nodes in a cooperative environment. It is often crucial for these communications to adhere to rigorous structures in order to achieve their goals. This work builds upon the recently developed multiparty session type theory and the session-oriented programming language, SessionJava. We present Multiparty SessionJava, as a framework for structuring distributed multiparty interactions. Our compiler and runtime extensions provide a foundation for type-checking these interactions to ensure type-safe communications based on projections of the global types. To our best knowledge this is the second exisiting attempt to provide a user friendly syntax and protocol-centred operations for typed multiparty interactions in Java.
